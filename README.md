This project is a WhatsApp Web clone (but better). we used React to build the client-side and asp.net to build the server-side.
we used the react-router library and the signalR library.
For the server-side please go to https://github.com/elaganot/Advanced-Programming-2-ex2.git.

To run the project please create a new React app, delete all the files except the node_modules directory,
and download all the files to your directory (that already has the node_modules).
Download all the files from the server-side git repository and run the server.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Notice that the client-side must run on port 3000 and the server side must run on port 7213.

To register press the "here" button in the login page that will take you to the register page,
then just write your details to register, notice that the password must include letters and numbers.

In the chat page you can add new contacts, and send text messages to your contacts.
